Programming Timeline (Educational App)

The BBC are looking to improve their online offering of educational content by developing some interactive apps that display information in a fun and interesting way.

This is an educational app providing a user with information regarding the major programming languages and changes over time. 

One of my roles was to create the interactive timeline. It allows the user to browse any programming language and also gives the feeling of interactivity using animation.

I also felt it was necessary to split the frontend and backend using seperate servers to show that they can be used separately.  

MVP
* It will be able to provide specific information about the languages.
* Interactive timeline of the history of computer programming languages.
* Display some information about a particular programming language.
* Have some user interactivity using event listeners, e.g to move through different sections of content
* Uses an API to access information from a database.

Installation Process
* Use node package manager to install dependencies in the root directory.
* Use node package manager to install dependencies in the client directory.
* Run the server in client and root directory via npm Start.
* Run webpack in client using npm run start_web.
* Run mongod and use seeds.js to seed db
